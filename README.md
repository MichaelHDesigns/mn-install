6. Type the following command: **getmasternodeoutputs**
7. Go to  **Tools -> "Open Masternode Configuration File"**
8. Add the following entry:
```
Format: alias VPS_IP:port masternodeprivkey collateral_output_txid collateral_output_index

```
9. Save and close the file.
10. Go to **Masternode Tab**. If you tab is not shown, please enable it from: **Settings - Options - Wallet - Show Masternodes Tab**

13. Alternatively, open **Debug Console** and type:
```
